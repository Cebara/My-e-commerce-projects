My projects where i have automated Registrattion, Login, Different ways to order a product, Search and some even have Contact form automated. These scripts/frameworks were written via Selenium which is Java based.
All my codes you can check under src> main/resources> test/java. In test/java you have helper class where majority of code was written and in test class you can run those tests
